This line represents the person's intellect, and ability to think and analyze things. They have a rational and logical approach to life.",
    shadow: "Intellectual Arrogance & Impulsivity: Lacking this plane indicates a need to develop mental discipline. One might be more impulsive than analytical, struggle with disorganization, or act without fully thinking through the consequences. They may also tend to look down on people who are not their intellectual equals.",
    additional: "This plane governs the 'World of Ideas.' When all three numbers are present, the person possesses a high IQ and the ability to process data rapidly. However, they may struggle with sleep as their minds 'never turn off.'"

    shadow: "Stubbornness: If the person does not have 4 in his grid, he can be very short-tempered and stubborn. They tend to hold on too tightly to their goals even when it's time to let go.",
    additional: "This is the 'Central Pillar' of the grid. It represents the backbone of the character. Without this arrow, even the best plans (4-3-8) or actions (2-7-6) may fail due to a lack of persistence."

  { name: "Arrow of Loneliness / Resignation", numbers: [3, 5, 7], desc: "Beyond mere skepticism, the absence of the spiritual plane (3-5-7) creates an 'Island Personality.'
